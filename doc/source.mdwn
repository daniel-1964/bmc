This is how to compile BMC from source.

    $ git clone git://bmc.branchable.com/ bmc
    $ mkdir -p build/bmc
    $ cd build/bmc
    $ cmake ../../bmc
    $ make

Run the test suite like this:

    $ make check

To install the binary programs and libraries onto your system, run:

    $ make install

bmc should be installed in /usr/local/bin now.
